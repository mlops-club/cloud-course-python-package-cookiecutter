"""
Unit tests for cookiecutter.repo_name.

This folder ideally has a parallel folder structure with the src/{{ cookiecutter.package_import_name }}/ folder.

In general, unit tests

- should be fast and test a single function or class
- should not depend on external resources (e.g., databases, network, etc.)
